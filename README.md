# clang-tags

`clang-tags` is a C / C++ source code indexing tool. Unlike many other indexing
tools, `clang-tags` relies on the [clang](http://clang.llvm.org) compiler (via
the libclang interface) to analyse and index the source code base.


## How to install


### Requirements

- `libclang` (>= 3.0)
- `python` (>= 2.3)
  - a version newer than 2.7 is recommended to benefit from the more recent `argparse` module.


### Build

`clang-tags` uses [`CMake`](http://www.cmake.org/) as a build system.

A complete build process could for example look like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/ffevotte/clang-tags.git src
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../src
```


## How to use

### Creating the compilation database

#### From a `cmake` project

`CMake` (since version 2.8.5) supports the generation of
[JSON compilation databases](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html) listing all
necessary information to build the project:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 ../src
```

#### Tracing the standard build process

```
clang-tags trace -- BUILD COMMAND
```

For non-CMake-managed projects, there is no free way to build the compilation database. One way to
get the necessary information consists in inspecting the build process as a black box using
[strace](http://linux.die.net/man/1/strace) (also see [bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear) for a
tool using `LD_PRELOAD` to implement the same kind of strategy).

Such a method is inherently independant of the build process: Makefile (possibly
autotools-generated), shell or python script, ... However, the downside with this approach is that
`make` and other build systems traditionally only rebuild what's needed, and the generated
compilation database can thus be incomplete.

Example usage:

```
make clean                 # Ensure that the whole project will be rebuilt
clang-tags trace -- make   # Generate the compilation database
```

#### Scanning `*.cxx` files

```
clang-tags scan SRC_DIR -- CLANG ARGS
```

For relatively simple projects, it can be sufficient to simply scan the top sources directory to
find all `*.c` or `*.cxx` files, and additionally provide `clang-tags` with a set of command-line
arguments necessary for `clang` to parse these files. For example:

```
clang-tags scan ../src -- -I.
```


### Creating the index

```
clang-tags index [--emacs-conf SRC_DIR]
```

This command uses the compilation database to index all source files. An
optional argument `--emacs-conf` allows generating a suitable `.dir-local.el`
emacs configuration file in the sources directory.


```
clang-tags update [--all]
```

This command updates the index. With the optional `--all` switch, the
compilation database is also rebuilt using the same subcommand `trace` or
`build` as previously.


### Using the Emacs UI

First, load the package using `M-x load-file RET path/to/clang-tags.el RET`

With the configuration file generated by the `clang-tags index` command, all
C/C++ source files in the indexed source directory should automatically activate
`clang-tags-mode` and have the `ct/default-directory` variable point to the
index directory.


#### Find the definition of the symbol at point

While in a source buffer, you can use `clang-tags` to find the location of the definition
of the symbol under point by pressing `M-.`.

The list of relevant definitions is presented in a buffer, where pressing `RET` will take you to the
location of the definition.

#### Find all uses of a definition in the source base

After having looked for a definition of the symbol under point, and while in the definitions list
buffer, press `M-,` to list all uses of the current definition in the source code base.

Results are presented in a `grep-mode` buffer.
