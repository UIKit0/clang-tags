# clang-tags

`clang-tags` is a C / C++ source code indexing tool. Unlike many other indexing
tools, `clang-tags` relies on the [clang](http://clang.llvm.org) compiler (via
the libclang interface) to analyse and index the source code base.

Its main features are:
- generating
  [compilation databases](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html)
  in a build-system-agnostic way,
- indexing a C/C++ project source files,
- finding the definition location of an identifier in a source file,
- finding all uses of a definition in the project sources.

The [quick start guide](http://ffevotte.github.com/clang-tags/quickStart.html)
is a good place to get a quick look at `clang-tags` various features.

Please see the [user manual](http://ffevotte.github.com/clang-tags) for a
complete description of `clang-tags` features and a usage documentation.
